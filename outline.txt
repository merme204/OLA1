Reflection

1. What changed between your Stage 1 outline and your final HTML? Why did you change it?
I added CSS styling to make the webpage more attractive. I also changed my table from movies to songs because it represents me better.

2. What was the hardest part to implement correctly, and why?
The hardest part was fixing the image and table background color. I had to make sure the image displayed correctly and the CSS worked properly.

3. Describe one mistake you made and how you fixed it.
One mistake I made was not closing a list tag correctly. I fixed it by checking my HTML code and adding the missing closing tag.
